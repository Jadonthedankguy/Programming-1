        <h1>Writing: Keyboard to Computer Or Pencil to Paper</h1>
        <h2>A writing career consists of writing stories, writing articles, any many more!</h2>
        <p>I'm interested in writing because I'm very good at writing on a computer(Not handwriting, my handwriting is garbage). I've written a book and my dream is to publish it and hopefully have people like it.</p>
